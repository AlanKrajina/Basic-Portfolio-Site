# Basic-Portfolio-Site

Basic Portfolio Site is the 1st project in Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The main focus of the project is the implementation of responsive design and the use of media queries.

# Project Specification

You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions, and links.

# Development Strategy

Before moving forward, make sure you are comfortable with the content from Intro to HTML and CSS and Responsive Web Design Fundamentals. For a quick self-assessment, ask yourself:

What are the basic sections of a document?
How can we represent metadata on a webpage?
What is an HTML element?
What is an attribute of an HTML element? How is it used?
What does adding a class attribute to an HTML element do? How does this relate to CSS?
What are some semantic HTML elements that you have learned? Pay special attention to the following:
<header>
<footer>
<section>
<article>
<nav>
<main>
How are ordered lists made? What about unordered lists?
How does an HTML file "know" which styles to apply? (i.e., how is a stylesheet linked to HTML?)
How are CSS properties set to specific values?
How does a media query help us conditionally apply CSS styles across different viewport sizes? Hint: Consider the @media CSS at-rule
How can you use operators like and, only, or not to create complex media queries?
How are grid-based layouts created (e.g., with flexbox)?
